This package can be used to write out the truth information of particles and hits from MC generated events.
For particles the run number, event number, pdg code, vertex and momentum is written out and for hits the
run number, event number, station, plane, module, row, sensor, local position, global position and pdg code of the
corresponding particle is written out.

To write out truth information generate MC data using the G4FaserAlgConfig_Test.py and run TrackerTruthDbg.py
