This package can be used to write out the data from simulated hits and from
tracks reconstructed with the TrackerSegmentFit algorithm.

To write out information for the simulated hits run G4FaserAlgConfig_Test.py
to simulate hits and TrackerTruthDbg.py to write out the information.

To write out information for the tracks run G4FaserAlgConfig_Test.py to
simulate hits, FaserSCT_DigitizationDbg.py to digitize them and
TrackerSegmentFitDbg.py to write out the information.
