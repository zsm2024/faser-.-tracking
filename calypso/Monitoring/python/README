Things to do:
-) Add some structure to the JSON config file, in particular, create
   some kind of set structure that will be reflected in ROOT file,
   but also groups monitored quantities by type.

-) Remove JSON text from ROOT file (or store in separate structure)

-) Figure out how to read ntuple variables.  Possibly have a 'handler' by 
   data type, i.e. TruthParticle or SpacePoints.  These will know how to 
   decode variables by simple string, and also might have their own config
   parameters to be set.
